Hi! I am Will, I am a Belgian digital journalist in the dual degree program in journalism and computer science at Columbia University. I have an M.S. degree in business engineering from KU Leuven in Belgium and I have worked as a software developer prior to moving to New York. I am interested in data journalism, the tech industry and the political and economical impact of technology.
