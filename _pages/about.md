Hi! I'm Will. I am interested in the political and economic impact of technology. Currently, I am enrolled in the dual degree program at Columbia University for journalism and computer science.

Before then, I worked as a software engineer at P&G, Data Camp and Cashforce in Belgium and New York. I also hold a masters and bachelors degree in finance and applied sciences from KU Leuven, Belgium.
