Hi! I am Will, I am a Belgian digital journalist in the dual degree program in journalism and computer science at Columbia University.

My portfolio is divided into three categories

**data**: visualizations, interactive maps and other projects on the crossroads between journalism and computer science.

**stories**: old-fashioned journalism - produced with pencil, notebook and tape recorder; news stories and columns.

**personal**: opinion pieces and personal essays - my personal take on the news and current events.
