As the final project for my "Frontiers of Computational Journalism" class with Mark Hansen in the Fall 2019 semester, I interviewed scientists researching the effects of climate change on cultural heritage sites, specifically the sites on the [UNESCO World Heritage list](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/){:target="_blank"}. Next, using Nuxt.js and D3 to build interactive visualizations to present their work in a more accessible way.

Below is a snapshot of the site. The full site is accessible [here](https://focj-climate.netlify.com/){:target="_blank"} and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/wdehaes/whs_climate_site){:target="_blank"}.
