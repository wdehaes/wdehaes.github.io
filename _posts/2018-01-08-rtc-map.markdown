As a final project for our Reporting class in the Fall 2018 semester, we did a series of stories on the rollout of the Right To Counsel, a legislative initiative to provide free legal counsel to any tenant in New York City facing eviction. Together with Aaron Brezel, I built an interactive map to show statistics per neighborhood, which accompanied the series.

The article, including the map, was originally published [here](http://theink.nyc/whats-gone-right-wrong-right-counsel/) on Nov. 9, 2018 . The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/wdehaes/marshalEvictionData).
