Hi! Over the past years I have blogged about my adventures while studying abroad, written articles about software development and even put in writing a handful of short stories. Some of my work (`work` sounds a bit pretentious, I know, but the only alternative I could think of was `oeuvre`, so, you know...) can be found spread out over the web. On this website, I want to publish some of what I have written over the years. The stuff that is (hopefully) still relevant and/or entertaining. No-one wants to read pimply 15-year-old Will's cringeworthy romantic contemplations.

That being said, I hope that over time most of the posts on this site will consist of new stories and observations. After all, I am about to embark on an exciting new adventure. On August 1, I am starting a two-year Dual Degree Master at Columbia University. What's a dual degree, I hear you asking, and isn't it a bit pretentious to write it with capital letters?
