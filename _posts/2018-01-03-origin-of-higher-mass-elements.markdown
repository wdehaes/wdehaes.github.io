This animation illustrates the origin of higher mass elements in the universe. Designed by **[Shruti Agrawal](https://shrutiagrawal.com/)**. It was built using jQuery and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap), as well as [Wheel-indicator](http://promo.github.io/wheel-indicator/) to track user scrolling behavior.

The interactive webpage is available **[here](https://originofhighermasselements.netlify.com){:target='_blank'}**. The animation can be controlled through scrolling.

Please note that it is intended for high-resolution screens with a 16:9 ratio (i.e. modern laptop/desktop). It will break on mobile.
